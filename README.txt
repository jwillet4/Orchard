This script takes in an argument via the command line.
The argument is the number of iterations of the game orchard you would like to use for the win statistic.
Run the file with the command below:

$ python Orchard.py 1000000

Running it at a million iterations should take about 2 minutes to finish.
From my trials, there is usually a win scenario 68.4% of the time.
No packages should be needed except for built in libraries. (sys, random)
